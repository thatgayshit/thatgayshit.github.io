Growing up in a small town, nobody was out as gay, and there was no way anyone was out as trans.

Transgender people were the butt of a joke, a Monty Python punchline,
men with 5 o'clock shadow with their shoulders busting out of too-small dresses.

When I came out my parents asked me why I didn't do it sooner, why I didn't know instinctively.

If you were in the wrong body you'd have to know right away, right?

Even if you'd never seen anybody like you. 

Even if you didn't know what it was called.

I moved to the city for school and I saw more visibly trans people.
Just at the store, walking down the street. Living their lives.

I always felt uncomfortable. Did I stare at them, like people stare at me now?

I don't remember. I couldn't think about them.

I bought some makeup. Concealer for under my eyes, to hide the dark circles.
I painted my nails, it was fun and colorful. 

'No reason,' I said.

Guys could paint their nails.

I've been transitioning for six months. The hormones are starting to change my face,
changing my body. They'll never undo everything. 

I practice my voice. I paint my nails.

People stare at me.
